# UNet Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of the UNet model for image segmentation tasks. UNet is a popular convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation and other segmentation tasks. This implementation is designed to be easily extendable and adaptable to various segmentation problems.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use implementation of the UNet architecture for segmentation tasks. This implementation can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems, especially in the medical field, where accurate and efficient segmentation is crucial.

## Features

- **UNet Architecture**: A fully functional UNet model ready for training and evaluation.
- **Training Loop**: A basic training loop has been implemented.

## Current Status

- Due to hardware limitations, I have not been able to perform extensive training. I just made sure that the training works. If you find any flaws feel free to reach out to me.
- There are ongoing developments for additional functionalities:
  - Prediction visualization
  - Conversion of predictions to classes
  - Metrics for evaluating segmentation performance

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
